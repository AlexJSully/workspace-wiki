# Test Document

This is a test Markdown document with `.md` extension.

## Purpose

This file tests the extension's handling of standard Markdown files, which should be:

- Automatically discovered and included in the tree
- Displayed with proper title normalization
- Openable in preview mode by default
- Support for full editing capabilities

## Content

This document contains various Markdown elements to ensure proper preview functionality:

- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://example.com)

### Code Block

```typescript
function example(): string {
	return 'Hello, World!';
}
```

### List Example

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

The extension should handle all these elements correctly when previewing or editing the file.
