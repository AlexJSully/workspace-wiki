Test Notes - Plain Text Format

This is a plain text file with .txt extension to test the Workspace Wiki extension's handling of non-Markdown documentation.

PURPOSE:
This file validates that the extension:
- Discovers and includes .txt files in the documentation tree
- Displays them with appropriate icons and context
- Opens them correctly in VS Code's text editor
- Treats them as documentation alongside Markdown files

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
Plain text files don't support rich formatting like Markdown, but they're still valuable for:
- Simple documentation
- Configuration notes
- Quick reference guides
- Legacy documentation that hasn't been converted to Markdown

TESTING POINTS:
1. File should appear in the Workspace Wiki tree view
2. Title should be normalized ("test-notes.txt" â†’ "Test Notes")
3. File should open in text editor when clicked
4. Should maintain proper alphabetical ordering with other file types

The extension should handle this plain text file seamlessly alongside Markdown and other supported formats, demonstrating its versatility for different documentation approaches.
