# Level One Documentation

This is a standard documentation file within the first-level subdirectory to test nested file handling.

## Position and Ordering

This file should appear within the "Level One Directory" node in the tree, demonstrating:

- **File discovery** in nested directories
- **Alphabetical sorting** within subdirectories
- **Title normalization** in nested context ("level-one.md" â†’ "Level One Documentation")
- **Standard file behavior** regardless of directory depth

## Content Validation

This document tests that the extension maintains full functionality for files in subdirectories:

### Formatting Support

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- `Inline code` and code blocks
- Lists and structured content

### Navigation

- Files should open correctly in preview/edit mode
- Tree navigation should work smoothly
- Context menus should provide appropriate options

```bash
# Example shell command
echo "Testing nested file content handling"
```

This ensures that nested files provide the same rich documentation experience as root-level files.
