# Level One Directory

This is the index file for subdirectory-1, demonstrating index file behavior in nested contexts.

## Purpose

This directory tests:

- **Nested index files** - How index.md works in subdirectories
- **Folder name replacement** - This title should replace "subdirectory-1" in the tree
- **Nested ordering** - Files within this subdirectory should follow standard ordering rules
- **Tree expansion** - Proper collapsible/expandable behavior

## Expected Behavior

When this subdirectory is displayed in the Workspace Wiki tree:

1. It should show as "Level One Directory" instead of "subdirectory-1"
2. It should be expandable/collapsible
3. Files within should be ordered alphabetically
4. The index.md file itself should not appear as a separate child (it IS the folder node)

## Content

This subdirectory contains additional test files to validate ordering and display within nested structures.
