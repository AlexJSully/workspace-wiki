Index File - Text Format

This is an index file in plain text format (.txt) to test how the Workspace Wiki extension handles non-Markdown index files.

PURPOSE:
This file tests whether the extension:
- Recognizes .txt files as potential index files
- Handles multiple index files in the same directory
- Maintains proper precedence between index.md and index.txt
- Shows appropriate behavior when index files have different extensions

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Since this directory already contains an index.md file, that should take precedence for folder naming. However, this index.txt should still be:
- Discovered and listed in the file tree
- Available for viewing/editing
- Properly ordered within the directory contents
- Handled with appropriate plain text context

TESTING SCENARIOS:
1. Multiple index files in same directory
2. Extension precedence (index.md should override index.txt for folder naming)
3. Plain text index file handling
4. File ordering with multiple index types present

This validates that the extension can handle complex scenarios where multiple index-style files exist in the same directory while maintaining predictable behavior.
