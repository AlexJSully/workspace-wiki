# Example Directory

The `example/` directory in this repository contains a variety of test and demonstration files and folders used to validate and showcase the features of the Workspace Wiki extension. It is not part of the extension code, but is used for:

- Testing file discovery, exclusion, and tree rendering logic
- Demonstrating support for different file types and directory structures
- Verifying handling of ignored files, hidden files, and special cases (e.g., README, index.md)
- Providing real-world scenarios for E2E and manual testing

**Subdirectories include:**

- `file-types-test/`: Contains files of many different types to test extension filtering and preview behavior
- `ignore-files-test/`: Contains ignored, hidden, and display files to test exclusion and hidden file logic
- `index-files-test/`, `nested-structure-test/`, etc.: Test tree structure, index/README handling, and nested folders

You can use the `example/` directory to experiment with extension settings and verify that the Workspace Wiki tree updates as expected.
